The ns-3 simulator is a discrete-event network simulator targeted primarily for research and educational use. The ns-3 project, started in 2006, is an open-source project developing ns-3. It has been developed to provide an open, extensible network simulation platform, for networking research and education. In brief, ns-3 provides models of how packet data networks work and perform, and provides a simulation engine for users to conduct simulation experiments.

We are installing ns-3 version 3.30 on Ubuntu distribution of Linux 
(Version 19.04- Disco Dingo).
Ubuntu can be downloaded from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
The following tools are needed to get started with ns-3:
C++ compiler                     			 
	clang++ or g++(g++ version 4.9 or greater)
Python	python2 version>=2.7.10 or python3   version>=3.4
Git	any recent version
Tar	any recent version (to unpack an ns-3 release)

Bunzip2	any recent version (to uncompress an ns-3 release)

Steps to install ns-3:-
1) Download ns-3 version 3.30 from https://www.nsnam.org. 
1) Open terminal on Ubuntu desktop.
2) Move to desktop using command
                cd Desktop.
3) Update and Upgrade your system and repositories using command
               sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade.
4) To install all the required libraries for ns-3 to work use command 
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ python python-dev mercurial bzr gdb valgrind gsl-bin libgsl0-dev libgsl0ldbl flex bison tcpdump sqlite sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-0 libgtk2.0-dev uncrustify doxygen graphviz imagemagick texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-generic-extra texlive-generic-recommended texinfo dia texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-extra-utils texlive-generic-recommended texi2html python-pygraphviz python-kiwi python-pygoocanvas libgoocanvas-dev python-pygccxml.
5) After the libraries are successfully installed (could take a while), extract the ns-3    archive saved on the desktop previously by simply using the command
                tar –xvf ns-allinone-3.29.tar.bz
Once it is extracted a folder named ns-allinone-3.29 appears on the desktop.
6) Move to ns-3 folder using
    	     cd ns-allinone-3.29
7) Now to enable the examples and test files (already present in ns-3) type command
	     ./build.py  - -enable-examples  - -enable-tests
    In this way ns-3 is finally installed.
To run sample script:-
1) Move to ns-allinone-3.29 examples  tutorial folder
                 cd ns-allinone-3.29/examples/tutorial <first move to desktop>
2) Tutorial file contains some examples. Copy any example in scratch folder by
	      cp first.cc ../../scratch
3) Move to directory ns-allinone-3.29
                 cd ../..
4) Run first.cc <example> using command
         	      . /waf  - -run scratch/first <filename>
